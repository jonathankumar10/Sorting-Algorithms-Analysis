# Sorting Algorthims and their Analysis

This Project was a course project that was to be made in Design and Analysis of Algorithms Class.
This project was done as part of the coursework in CSE-5311 at UTA in Spring 2020.

Implemented various sorting algorithms from scratch in python and compared them.

Used matplotlib.pylot as a helper library.

Was able to give the user a choice of different algorithms to choose from and also give a graphical representation of how the algorithm did for 100 inputs.
